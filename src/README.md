# README - Algorithme de Karger #
## _Supervised by Mr. Damien Vergnaud_

This project was carried out by El Bouhali Mouataz, Jankovskaja Elina and Sadykova Karima in the context of the EU COMPLEX: Complexity, Randomized algorithms and approximation. It was supervised by Mr. Damien Vergnaud in tutorials and lectures.

It implements Karger's algorithm with matrices and adjacency lists on different types of graphs.
It also has functions for drawing curves and analyzing performance mainly on 4 types of graphs:
- complete graphs
- bipartite graphs
- cyclic graphs
- random generated graphs

## Files and implemented functions

- q1b-bis.py/q2a.py/q2c.py/q3e.py/q3ebis.py : trace curves depending on the number of vertexes and the probability of success using different structures(q3e.py has yet to be implemented).
- q1b.py : trace curves depending on the time taken by the algorithm
- q1c.py : implementation of Karger's algorithm using 2D matrices
- q1e.py : implementation of Karger's matrices using adjacency lists
- q3d.py : implementation at Karger/Stein algorithm using adjencency matrices

## Running the program

To run the program, simply run:

```sh
python3 q<requested_num><requested_letter>.py
```

Different tests are available at the end of each file.
